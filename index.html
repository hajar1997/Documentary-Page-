            <h1>Historical Background</h1>
            <article>
                <p>The historical background, causes and essential elements of the present day Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict.
                </p>
                <h2>1. The resettlement of Armenians in the territory of Azerbaijan</h2>
                <p>The Russian Empire regarded the Armenian Christian population living in the Ottoman Empire and Iran as a key element in the achievement of its far-reaching Eastern policy, which was designed to secure for Russia access to the shores of
                    the Persian Gulf. The Russian authorities began to exploit the Armenian factor as early as the eighteenth century.</p>

                <p>Taking advantage of the weakened condition of the Safavid State, on 10 November 1724 Peter I (Peter the Great) issued a decree allowing the Armenians who were being assigned the role of a “fifth column” in implementing the Russian Empire’s
                    plans to seize vast territories to the south of the Caucasus – as far as the Persian Gulf – to settle in a strip of Azerbaijani land located along the Caspian Sea and containing the cities of Derbent and Baki as well as the regions
                    of Gilyan, Mazandaran and Gorgan. As part of this scheme, the Russian generals were instructed to “displace” the local Azerbaijani population in any way they could. However, Russia’s subsequent military reversals in the Caucasus blocked
                    this planned resettlement of the Armenians.
                </p>
                <p>Under the terms of the Turkmanchai Treaty, 40,000 Armenians were resettled in Azerbaijan. Following the conclusion in 1829 of the Peace Agreement in Edirne, 90,000 Armenians who had been living in the Ottoman Empire were also resettled
                    in Azerbaijan. The Russian authorities resettled the Armenians primarily on the territory of the Nakhchivan, Iravan and Karabakh khanates.</p>
                <p>
                    As the well-known Russian diplomat and writer, A.S.Griboyedov, has written, “the Armenians have for the most part been settled on the lands of Muslim landowners… The settlers… are forcing out the Muslims… We also discussed at some length the work of persuasion
                    to be done with the Muslims in order to reconcile them to their present hardships, which would not continue for a long time, and to rid them of the fear that the Armenians would maintain permanent possession of the lands to which they
                    had once been allowed to move” .[9]</p>
                <h3>2. Pogroms</h3>
                <p>In pursuing their colonial policy in the Southern Caucasus, the leaders of the Russian Empire banked heavily on the Armenians resettled in Azerbaijan. In the work of the American scholar, Justin McCarthy, the following data are given on
                    the colonization of the Southern Caucasus or, more accurately, of Azerbaijan by the Armenians.</p>
                <p>Between 1828 and 1920, when a policy was being implemented to alter the demographic structure of the population of Azerbaijan in favour of the Armenians and to the detriment of the Azerbaijanis, “over two million Muslims were forcibly
                    exiled and an unknown number of them were killed… On two occasions, in 1828 and 1854, the Russians invaded Eastern Anatolia… and on both occasions they were forced to retreat, taking 100,000 Armenians with them to the Caucasus, where
                    they were resettled in place of the Turks (Azerbaijanis) who had emigrated or perished. </p>

                <p> In the war of 1877-1878, Russia seized the Kars-Ardagan district, forced out the Muslims and settled 70,000 Armenians there… During the events of 1895-1896, approximately 60,000 Armenians were resettled in the Caucasus… Migration during
                    the First World War was fairly balanced. 400,000 Armenians from Eastern Anatolia were exchanged for 400,000 Muslims from the Caucasus” .[10]</p>

                <p>According to the figures given by this American academic, 560,000 Armenians were resettled in Azerbaijan between 1828 and 1920. In this way, it was precisely after the conquest of the Southern Caucasus by Russia that the Armenian population
                    on the territory of Azerbaijan north of the River Araks began to increase rapidly.</p>

                <p>Quite noteworthy in this same connection is also the admission of Z.Balaian: “Its (Yerevan’s) residents are people who have come from other places. There are practically no true Yerevanites”[11] . Academician A.I.Ionisian writes that “one-fourth
                    of the population of the city of Erivan were Armenians, with the Azerbaijanis constituting a majority” .[12]
                </p>
                <p>In accordance with a decree of the Russian Emperor Nicholas I of 21 March 1828, the Nakhchivan and Iravan khanates in Azerbaijan were abolished and replaced by a new administrative unit known as the “Armenian Oblast [Region]”, governed
                    by Russian officials. In 1849 this region was renamed the Erivan Guberniya [Province]. </p>

                <p>In pursuit of their far-reaching goals, the Armenians succeeded in bringing about the abolition by the Russian authorities in 1836 of the Albanian Christian Patriarchate, which had been operating in Azerbaijan, and the transfer of its
                    property to the Armenian Church. Somewhat later, in a situation where the population in the western districts of the former Albania, namely the Karabakh region which Armenian elements were continuing to penetrate in the nineteenth
                    century – had lost both statehood and ecclesiastical independence, there began a process of the Gregorianization (i.e. Armenianization) of the local Albanian population. </p>

                <p>The truth of this situation was already well known in the nineteenth century. The famous Russian historian, V.L.Velichko, wrote: “An exception were the inhabitants of Karabakh, incorrectly called Armenians …, who professed the Armenian-Gregorian
                    faith…and who had gone through the process of Armenianization only three to four centuries earlier.” This was also known by the Armenian author, B. Ishkhanian, who wrote: “The Armenians residing in Nagorno-Karabakh are partly aborigines
                    and descendants of the ancient Albanians …, and partly refugees from Turkey and Iran, for whom Azerbaijani lands offered a refuge from persecution. and oppression.” [13]</p>

                <p>The ideological justification for the territorial claims of the Armenians in the Southern Caucasus were linked to the formation of the nationalist parties “Armenakan” in 1885 in France, “Gnchak” (Bell) in 1887 in Geneva, and “Dashnakzutyun”
                    (Union) in 1890 in Tiflis (Tbilisi). These parties set themselves the task of using armed uprisings and terrorist actions to unite the territories on which Armenians – who had been resettled from Iran and the Ottoman Empire – were
                    living. The “Gnchak” programme contains, in particular, the following call: “To kill Turks and Kurds under any conditions, never to spare Armenians who have betrayed their cause, and to take revenge upon them” . [14] </p>

                <p>“Dashnakzutyun” was an authentic Nazi-style party, which anticipated by 30 years the ideology of the National Socialist Party of Germany and whose programme contained the words: “The objective of the Dashnakzutyun Party is to form an anarchist,
                    democratic republic. The means of achieving this objective are the following: 1) armed insurrection; 2) intensive work to develop a revolutionary mentality among not only the Armenians; 3) the arming and organization of the Armenians;
                    4) terror and the destruction of government persons and institutions” . [15] “To achieve this objective, everything is permitted: propaganda, terror, merciless guerrilla warfare.” [16]
                </p>
                <p>Recounting the consequences of the activities of the Dashnakzutyun, the Georgian writer, Karibi, wrote with bitterness in 1919: “The Dashnaks arrived, bringing with them national hatred. And on such a soil, need it be said, nothing but
                    Armenian-Muslim carnage and war between Armenia and Georgia was able to grow.”[17] </p>

                <p>It was organizations of this kind, together with the authorities of the Russian Empire, who were intent on curbing the revolutionary and nationalist liberation movement in the Caucasus, that provoked the first confrontations between Armenians
                    and Azerbaijanis in 1905. Between 1907 and 1912 approximately half a million Armenians from the Ottoman Empire and Iran moved to the Kars, Erivan and Elizavetpol regions, where a vast majority of the population was made up of Azerbaijanis.
                    This movement of population took place with the connivance of the Russian administration, whose aim was to push the situation in the area of inter-ethnic relations to the limit and so strengthen Russia’s dominion over the region.[18]</p>
                <h2>3. The transfer of Azerbaijani territories to Armenia</h2>
                <p>The migration of Armenians to the Southern Caucasus in the first half of the nineteenth century and their settlement mainly in Azerbaijan was accompanied by the separation of territory from Azerbaijan and its incorporation in the “Armenian
                    Oblast” that had been created within the Russian Empire. The expansion of the territory of Armenia continued into the present century. As recently as 29 May 1918, the Government of the Azerbaijan Republic ceded part of the Erivan district
                    (the former Iravan Khanate) to the Republic of Armenia. This also, however, proved to be too little for the Armenian Government. Between 1918 and 1920 part of Karabakh, Zangazur and the Lake Geicha (now Sevan) district. A total area
                    of 9,000 square kilometres was seized by force of arms. </p>
                <p>
                    After the formation of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, its leaders at the time did not demand the return of the Azerbaijani territories. On the contrary, there then ensued the next “peaceful” stage of land seizure, realized with assistance from
                    the Communist leadership of Russia and the Soviet Union. In 1921, Armenia’s “acquisition” of the Zangazur district and a significant part of the Gazakh district, totalling approximately 9,000 square kilometres and populated to a large
                    extent by Azerbaijanis, was legalized.[19] As a result of the transfer of Zangazur to Armenia, the Nakhchivan area was cut off from Azerbaijan. </p>
                <p>
                    In 1922 the Bolsheviks dealt in similar fashion with the Azerbaijani lands of Dilijan and Geija. In 1929 a number of villages were taken from Nakhchivan and annexed to the Armenian SSR. In 1969 the Armenian SSR again expanded its territory at the expense
                    of Azerbaijan by taking land as far east as the Gadabay district. Under pressure from the central authorities, Azerbaijan “transferred” a number of villages in the Gazakh district to Armenia.</p>
                <h2>4. The Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region of the Azerbaijan SSR</h2>
                <p>
                    The Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region (NKAO) occupied the south-eastern part of the Lesser Caucasus and covered an area of 4,388 square kilometres. The territory of the region stretched for 120 kilometres from north to south and for 35-60 kilometres
                    from east to west. It included five administrative areas – Askaran, Gadrut, Mardakert, Martuni and Shusha. The chief town was Khankandi (Stepanakert). The population of the NKAO, according to estimates for the beginning of 1989, was
                    187,000. It consisted of: 137,200 Armenians (73.4%), 47,400 Azerbaijanis (25.3%), 2,400 representatives of other nationalities (1.3%). [20]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Contrary to the assertions of Armenian nationalist leaders concerning violations of the rights of the Armenian minority in Azerbaijan, the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region possessed all the fundamental attributes of self-government and achieved a high
                    rate of development in the social, economic and cultural fields. The well-known historian and specialist in Turkic affairs, Audrey Alstadt, says that “…Armenian villages were incorporated within the territorial borders [of the former
                    NKAO when it was artificially established by the Bolsheviks], whereas Azerbaijani villages were excluded in order to ensure an Armenian majority” [21].
                </p>
                <p>
                    Audrey Alstadt further notes that in the former NKAO “the Armenian language was designated as an official language for administrative purposes and in everyday life” and that “the staffs of territorial, legislative and party organs, as well as the senior
                    staff members and employees of cultural and educational establishments, were, in the overwhelming majority, Armenians from the moment of the creation [of the former NKAO] [22].
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the facts in question, the writer concludes that “the cultural and administrative character of the region favoured Azerbaijani emigration … and, as regards the problems and abuses that existed [in the former NKAO], they should be laid at the door
                    of the local Armenians who … were administering Nagorno-Karabakh, and not of Baku [23].
                </p>
                <p>
                    The legal status of the NKAO, under the Constitution of the Azerbaijan SSR, was defined by the Law on the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region adopted on the recommendation of the Soviet of People’s Deputies of the NKAO by the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region, as a national-territorial entity, enjoyed administrative autonomy and, accordingly, possessed a number of rights that in practice allowed the specific requirements of its population to be met. Under the Constitution
                    of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), the NKAO was guaranteed representation by five deputies in the Soviet of Nationalities (one of the two equal chambers of the parliament) of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Twelve
                    deputies from the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region sat in the Supreme Soviet of the Azerbaijan SSR.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Soviet of People’s Deputies of the NKAO . the organ of State authority in the Region . was vested with a broad spectrum of powers. It took decisions on all local matters, on the basis of the interests of citizens living in the territory covered by
                    the Soviet, bearing in mind national and other particularities of the Autonomous Region. The Council of People’s Deputies of the NKAO participated in the consideration of issues affecting the whole Republic and made its proposals concerning
                    them. All organs of State authority and government administration, the judiciary and the Office of the Public Prosecutor, the managements of production enterprises, and the educational and cultural institutions conducted their work
                    in the Armenian language, in line with the linguistic needs of the population.
                </p>
                <p>During the rule of the Soviet Union, the Nagorno-Karabakh region developed faster than Azerbaijan as a whole. Thus, while the industrial output of the Republic as a whole rose by a factor of 3 in the period from 1970 to 1986, the figure
                    for the NKAO was 3.3 (annual growth rates here were above 8.3 per cent). Capital investment rose by a factor of 3.1 in the period from 1970 to 1986 in the Region, and by a factor of 2.5 in the Republic. The basic indices for social
                    development (living standards) in the NKAO exceeded the average indices for the Azerbaijan SSR and the Armenian SSR. Particularly noteworthy was the higher level, in comparison with the Republic, of the provision of housing, goods
                    and services to the population. The housing space available to each inhabitant of the NKAO was nearly one-third greater than the average for the Republic. Per inhabitant of the Region, there were more intermediate-level medical personnel
                    (by a factor of 1.3) and more hospital beds (by 3 per cent).
                </p>
                <p>Possessing an advantage over practically all the other regions of Azerbaijan in terms of coverage by cultural and educational institutions (schools providing general education, specialised secondary educational establishments, general
                    libraries, museums, clubs, and arts and crafts (page 19) centres) geared to the linguistic needs of the local population.</p>
                <p>The Autonomous Region enjoyed the most favourable conditions for the preservation of the identity of the Karabakh Armenians and, in general, of the ethnic and cultural particularities of the area. Not only was there a network of music
                    and drama clubs, but a professional company performed in the regional capital at the Drama Theatre, where most of the plays staged were by Armenian playwrights.
                </p>
                <p>Persons passing the university qualification examination who wished to receive a higher education without leaving the country had the possibility of entering the Pedagogical Institute in Khankandi (Stepanakert). Scientific personnel were
                    concentrated in two scientific institutions, in the Leninavan community and the main town of the NKAO. Five periodical publications in Armenian appeared in the Region. Unlike other administrative-territorial units of Azerbaijan located
                    at a distance from the capital of the Republic in mountainous areas, the Region had its own infrastructure for the reception of television and radio programs.</p>
                <p>The whole history of the development of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region within Azerbaijan, which became a kind of promised land for several generations of descendants of the Armenians who had earlier settled there, shows that this
                    development was in conformity with the interests of the Armenian population of Nagorno Karabakh and the economic, social and demographic features of this area. Moreover, this region enjoyed, in accordance with the principle of “positive
                    discrimination” that is widely applied in the civilised world, a privileged place in comparison to the rest of Azerbaijan.
                </p>
                <p>The Armenians, who were first resettled during the nineteenth century by the Tsarist authorities in the Azerbaijani lands of Nakhchivan, Iravan and Karabakh, and who in the 1920s, with the support of the Bolsheviks, created the Armenian
                    SSR on the territory of the former Iravan Khanate and an autonomous district in the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan, have now waxed insolent to the point where they are demanding independence for the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh,
                    with a view to uniting them, at a later stage, with Armenia itself. Will there ever be an end to this expansion?

            <h1>Occupied Territories</h1>
            <p>Nagorny Karabakh and adjacent administrative regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan – Lachin, Kelbajar, Gubadli, Zangilan, Jebrayil, Agdam (regional center and a large part of the territory) and Fizuli (regional center and a large part of the
                territory) were occupied by Armenia from 1989 to 1993.</p>
            <p>
                Nagorny Karabakh and adjacent administrative regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan – Lachin, Kelbajar, Gubadli, Zangilan, Jebrayil, Agdam (regional center and a large part of the territory) and Fizuli (regional center and a large part of the territory)
                were occupied by Armenia from 1989 to 1993. At present, Armenians transgressed a total of 558 km of the state border – the 198 km Azerbaijani-Iranian border from Horadiz settlement of the Fizuli region to the borders of the Zangilan region,
                and 360 km Azerbaijani-Armenian border. These territories are now under complete control of the Armenian military forces. Armenian forced destroyed buildings, outposts, frontier posts and demarcation lines from the USSR period along the
                border. The occupied areas along the Azerbaijani-Iranian borders are currently used for uncontrolled smuggling and sometimes for transportation of drugs. Construction materials for residential and public building and cut forest trees are
                transported from the occupied regions of Azerbaijan through the seized borders to Iran by Armenia.
            </p>
            <p>This robbery, inherited from the ancient historical times, carried out by Armenia which currently introduces itself as a “civilized” state throws down a challenge not only to Azerbaijan but to the world community which shuts its eyes to all
                of that.
            </p>
            <p>Other from that, the Kerki settlement of Sadarak region in Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, Ashagi Akipara, Yukhari Askipara, Gushchu Ayrim, Barkhudarli settlements of Gazakh region and other ones situated at the Azerbaijan-Armenia border
                were destroyed and occupied.
            </p>
            <p>The occupation of these villages represents a serious danger to the water reservoir, which was built on the Agstafa River and is of a high economic importance for the western regions of Azerbaijan. Irrigation canals with a length of 72.3 km
                supply 120 million cubic meters of water from the Agstafa reservoir to agricultural areas in the foothills, and to the settlements of Gazakh, Agstafa, Tovuz and Shamkir administrative regions.
            </p>
            <p>Nagorny Karabakh is the only conflict area in the former USSR where the borders of an autonomous republic were exceeded and surrounding territories were occupied as well. For example, the conflict area in Abkhazia autonomous republic does
                not cross the limits of the autonomous republic and not a single inch of the surrounding territories was occupied. What are the international principles and laws which were followed in occupation of Nagorny Karabakh and surrounding regions
                of Azerbaijan – Lachin, Kelbejer, Gubadli, Zangilan Jabrayil, Fizuli and Agdam.
            </p>
            <p>The occupied areas have different natural monuments, rare species of plants and animals. Occupied mountain zone of the Small Caucasus is a wide forest region. The total forest area is 246,700 hectares.
            </p>
            <p>There were established several natural reserves and game reserves in the occupied territories of the Minor Caucasus in order to preserve the natural landscape, rare specires of plants and animals. Among them are Basimchay reserve, Lachin game
                reserve and others. Basimchay reserve was established in 1974 in Basimchay ravine of the occupied Zangilan area in the South-West of Azerbaijan. It occupies an area of 107 hectares covered with Eastern planes. The plane forests stretch
                to 12 km along the river. Some trees are over 500 years old. The Eastern Plane is entered into the Red Book.
            </p>
            <p>Lachin game reserve was established in 1961 in the occupied Lachin region of Azerbaijan. Its area is 21,4 thousand hectares. Caucasian goats (about 400 heads), roe deers (500), steppe wild boars (400), francolins (800), partridges (2500) were
                protected in this game reserve. The Khary Bulbul, which can be found only in Shusha area in Azerbaijan, is a symbol of Karabakh.
            </p>
            <p>The occupied regions are rich in underground and land natural resources. The most widespread minerals are nonferrous metal ores, gold, mercury, chromite, pearlite, lime, marble, agate, mineral waters and others. The resort-recreation potential
                of the territory is wide too. </p>

            <p>Over 250,000 Azerbaijanis who lived in the territory of Armenia through the time of history, were all deported to their native lands and took shelter in Azerbaijan as the result of the last ethnical cleansing, carried out by Armenians in 1988-1992s.</p>

            <p>
                The plan of forced deportation of Azerbaijanis from 126 settlements in Nagorny Karabakh which formed an integral part of Azerbaijan, was carried out since 1988. One of the most tragic acts was committed exactly during that period. The town of Khodjali
                with the population of 7,000 in Nagorny Karabakh, was razed to the ground by Armenian military forces with the support of Soviet troops. 613 peace residents were killed with special barbarism and cruelty, 150 people are reported missed.
                1,000 peaceful residents became invalids of various categories, 1,275 persons – elderly persons, women, children were taken hostages and subjected to awful humiliation, oppression and torture.

            <p>20% of Azerbaijan lands – Nagorny Karabakh and adjacent 7 regions were occupied; 600,000 people were deprived of permanent residence and became internal displaced persons, taking shelter in 62 towns and regions, and more than 1,600 living
                stations of the republic, in result of military aggression of Armenian armed forces against our country since 1988.</p>

                There are also 11,000 persons, seeking for “refugee” status (shelter), in Azerbaijan. Majority of them is Russian citizens of Chechen origin, Afghans and persons from Iran, Irag, Palestine.
            </p>
            <p>Thus, there are about million refugees, internal displaced persons and people seeking to get “refugee” status (shelter) in Azerbaijan at present.

                46 women and 69 elderly persons) are still kept in Armenia until now. According to the International Committee of Red Cross, 439 persons were captured.
            </p>
            <p>It is impossible to calculate damage, caused by Armenian aggression to Azerbaijan national culture in Nagorny Karabakh and adjacent regions. Destroyed material and spiritual wealth is not only unexampled culture patterns of Azerbaijan, but
                also whole world. According to primary data, more than USD 60 billion damage were caused to Azerbaijan economy along with psychological shock.</p>

                commitments and provisions was adopted. According to that decision, the participants of the Minsk Conference were: Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belorussia, Turkey, Russia, USA, France, Germany, Italy, Czechoslovakia and Sweden. The Decision also
                noted that the elected and other representatives (representatives of the Azerbaijani and Armenian population) of Nagorno-Karabakh, as interested Parties, would be invited to the Minsk Conference by its Chairman after consultations with
                the states participating in the Conference.</p>
            <p>Since 1992 the negotiations have been conducting within the framework of the Minsk Conference. The Chairmen of the Minsk Conference were:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Italy in 1992-1993,</li>
                <li>Sweden in 1994,</li>
                <li>Russia, Finland in 1995-1996,</li>
                <li>Russia, USA, France – since 1997 up to the present.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Negotiations within the Minsk Group were held since 1992. According to the practice, the composition of the Minsk Group is being changed depending on the “Troika” of the OSCE. (“Troika” is made up by the former, present and future OSCE Chairman-in-Office).
                <p>
                    <p>
                        Now Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, USA, France, Russia, Netherlands, Finland, Portugal, Germany, Italy, Sweden and Turkey are members of the Minsk Group.
                    </p>
                    <p>At present the Co-Chairmen of the Minsk Group are: Russia (Yuri Merzlyakov), USA (Steven Mann), France (Henry Jakolin).

            <h1>International Crime</h1>
            <h3>Armenian Terrorism in Azerbaijan</h3>
            <p>Along with its open aggression against Azerbaijan, Armenia is actively engaged in subversive activity on Azerbaijani territory.</p>
            <p>
                «Acts, methods and practices of terrorism constitute a grave violation of the purposes and principles of the United Nations, which may pose a threat to international peace and security, jeopardize friendly relations among States, hinder international
                cooperation and aim at the destruction of human rights, fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of society».
            </p>
            <p>From the Declaration on Measures to eliminate international terrorism adopted by the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-ninth session, 1994 (Resolution 49/60).
            </p>
            <p>The Armenian secret service and various Armenian terrorist organizations systematically and deliberately perpetrate acts of terrorism against peaceful citizens in Baku, Ganja and other major centers of Azerbaijan, targeting industrial units
                and transportation means. Available data indicate that Armenian terrorist organizations have substantial resources at their disposal as well as ample «experience» in preparing and implementing terrorist acts.
            </p>
            <p>There ample proof of Armenia’s responsibility for terrorist activities against Azerbaijan and other States, its cooperation with various terrorist organizations, and its assistance to terrorist organizations by making its territory available
                to them for use as bases and training camps against the States of the region.
            </p>
            <p>Evidence of the special relationship between Armenia and international terrorists can be seen, for example, in the fact that signatures of 1,227,473 Armenians were collected, defending Varujan Karapetyan, a terrorist, who was sentenced in
                France to life imprisonment for placing explosives near the office of Turkish Airlines at Orly Airport. The sixth grade at a school in Yerevan had already been named in his honor, and in Yerevan and Echmiadzin exhibitions of his paintings
                were organized. As a sign of sympathy for the terrorist, President Levon Ter-Petrosyan asked his French counterpart Jacques Chirac, to pardon V. Karapetyan. The President of Armenia participated in the memorial service, attended by 50,000
                people for the well-known international terrorist Monte Melkonyan and also was present at the latter’s funeral in Yerevan.
            </p>

            <p>The use of terrorism to implement Armenia’s aggressive plans has bloody historic antecedents. Armenian terrorist organisations began to emerge in the late nineteenth century in the form of the Institute of Violence. Aimed at the establishment
                of «Greater Armenia». Armenian terrorism assumed global dimensions in the early 1970’s. When terrorist training bases appeared in a number of countries. Activity of such terrorist organizations as the «Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation
                of Armenia» (ASALA), «The Commandos of Justice of the Armenian Genocide» and the «Armenian Revolutionary Army» was carried out mainly in the countries of Western Europe and North America.
            </p>
            <p>Unlike the nationalist parties Hnchak and Dashnakhsutiun, which formulated an ideological platform based on a policy of assertion of territorial claims, these organizations fall into a strictly military-terrorist category dealing with «practical
                problems» in implementation of the «projects» devised by their ideologues. They are to blame for murdering hundreds of people.
            </p>
            <p>It is an established fact, for example, that the founder of the ASALA Akop Akopyan, began his dismal career as a member of the terrorist group that massacred the Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympic Games in 1972.
            </p>
            <p>In January 1978 a terrorist group consisting of S. Zatikyan, Z. Bagdarsyan and A.Stepanyan caused an explosion in the Moscow underground railway system, whose victims were innocent citizens, including women and children.
            </p>
            <p>The foremost acts of Armenian international terrorism occurred in the 1980s, when ASALA was involved in the organization of a series of bomb blasts in Paris. Ten people were killed and 150 injured as a result of these terrorist acts.</p>
            <h2>Acts of Armenian Terrorism in Azerbaijan</h2>
            <p>In 1984 a passenger bus on the No.l06 route was blown up in Baku, killing one woman – mother of two children – and injuring several other people. Azerbaijani Special Forces have detained the terrorist responsible for the crime, identified
                as an Armenian named Vartanov.</p>
            <figure style="border:none;" class="truck">
                <img style="width:30%;" class="district-images" src="https://karabakh.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/armenianTerror_05_14_b.jpg" alt="Terrorism">
            </figure>
            <p>Since the late 1980s, Armenian terrorism in the former USSR has tended to increase, particularly following Armenia’s territorial claims on Azerbaijan and the launching of armed operations in the Mountainous Karahakh region of the Republic
                of Azerbaijan.</p>
            <p>
                From early 1988 terrorism in Armenia was elevated to state policy and its sole target became the territory of Azerbaijan. Weapons and ammunition were transported from Armenia, to the Mountainous Karabakh region into the hands of the underground Armenian
                terrorist groups. In 1988 alone, more than 100 cases of the illegal manufacture and theft of firearms were uncovered by the law enforcement agencies of Azerbaijan. During the same year, Armenian terrorists perpetrated 32 terrorist acts
                on the territory of the Mountainous Karabakh region of Azerbaijan and in districts bordering Armenia.
            </p>
            <p>Terrorists have disrupted roads between Azerbaijani villages and on numerous occasions blew up bridges and other vital facilities, including the pipeline supplying Ganja (Azerbaijani second largest city) with its drinking water.
            </p>
            <p>On October 7, 1989 a bridge across the river Halfalichay on the southern edge of the town of Khankendi, was destroyed. On 29 April 1992, the perpetrator of this terrorist act – A. Abramyan – was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment.
            </p>
            <p>Over the period from January 19 to February 17, 1990, a terrorist group based in Yerevan carried out numerous raids from the territory of Armenia on the innocent inhabitants of frontier villages in the Gazakh district of Azerbaijan. These
                violent actions resulted, among others, in the death of F. Mustafayev, inhabitant of Khirimly village, and S. Magerrarnov and N. Guliev, both shepherds from Sofulu village. The same terrorist group carried out an attack on a patrol vehicle
                of the Gazakh district division of internal affairs. Two members of the group, L. Arutyunyan and A. Mkrtchyan, detained by the law enforcement agencies of Azerbaijan, were sentenced to five and six years imprisonment.
            </p>
            <p>On February 18, 1990 an explosion in a bus on the Shusha-Baku line injured 13 people.
            </p>
            <p>On March 4, 1990 Armenian terrorists blew up the Nabiyar-Shusha pipeline, which supplied the town of Shusha with drinking water.
            </p>
            <p>On July 11, 1990 between the settlements of Getavan and Charektar in the Agdere district of Azerbaijan, an armed assault was launched on a road convoy in route to the town of Kelbajar. In that terrorist act, three people were killed and 23
                injured.
            </p>
            <p>On June 19, 1992 A. Airiyan was identified during the investigation as the perpetrator of this crime.</p>
            <figure class="exploded-bus">
                <img class="district-images" src="https://karabakh.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/armenian-terror-in-karabakh2.jpg" alt="Terrorism">
            </figure>
            <p>On August 10, 1990 in the Khanlar district of Azerbaijan, Armenian terrorists blew up an inter-city bus operating on the Tbilisi-Aghdam route, killing 20 passengers and injuring 30. Armenians, who perpetrated that terrorist act were arrested
                just when they were going to carry out their plan to blow up, on June 17, 1991 a bus on the Agdam-Tbilisi route.
            </p>
            <p>M. Grigoryan, a member of the terrorist organization Yerkrapakh, based in Armenia, set up a terrorist group of inhabitants of the Echmiadzin district of Armenia. In November 1990, they were sent to Azerbaijan. This group was disarmed by the
                law enforcement agencies of Azerbaijan while attempting to carry out acts of terrorism and sabotage. By its decision of June 18, 1991, the Supreme Court of the Republic of Azerbaijan sentenced the members of the group: T. Khachatryan –
                to nine years; Z. Oganyan – eight years, and A. Grigoryan – seven years in prison.
            </p>
            <p>On January 9, 1991 on the Lachin-Shusha road in the area of Galadarasi village, Armenian terrorists fired on a UAZ-469 vehicle, killing, among others, a journalist from the newspaper «Molodezh Azerbaidzhana» – Ms Salatyn Askerova, born 1969,
                who left an infant son.</p>

                <figcaption>Salatyn Askerova murder crime scene </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>On 23 March 1993, the perpetrators of this crime – A. Mkrtchyan, G. Petrosyan, A. Mangasaryan, G. Arutyunyan and G. Arustamyan, who, in addition to the aforementioned case, had been responsible for other acts of terrorism and murders – were
                sentenced to death, and other members of the terrorist group to different imprisonment sentences.
            </p>
            <p>In terms of safety, the most vulnerable of transportation facilities is rail transport. Besides, acts of terrorism on transport can clearly result in a considerable number of victims, in accordance with a previously arranged plan. Armenians
                started a terrorist campaign on passenger trains.
            </p>
            <p>On May 27, 1989 on a train from Yerevan to Baku, an Armenian citizen, V. Minasyan was arrested and found to be in possession of an explosive device. In her statement she confessed that she had been intending to carry out an act of sabotage
                in Baku.
            </p>
            <p>On July 24, 1989 there was an explosion on a train at Karchevan station.
            </p>
            <p>On May 30, 1991 11 people were killed and 22 injured following, an explosion on a passenger train from Moscow to Baku near Khasavyurt station (Russian Federation).
            </p>
            <p>In May 1991 officials of law enforcement agencies arrested S. Aznaryan, an inhabitant of the Novemberyan district of Armenia, in a Baku-Tbilisi train at Shamkir station. He was carrying two mines, a sub-machine-gun and maps of the Azerbaijan’s
                rail and highway network.
            </p>
            <p>On February 28, 1993 11 people were killed and 18 injured near Gudermes station (Russian Federation) by a bomb placed in a Baku-Kislovodsk train.
            </p>
            <p>On June 2, 1993 a passenger carriage was blown up in a siding at Baku railway station. On July 22, 1994 one I. Khatkovskiy was found guilty of committing this crime and sentenced to eight years.
            </p>
            <p>On February 1, 1994 the Kislovodsk-Baku passenger train was blown up at Baku station, killing 3 people and injuring more than 20.
            </p>
            <p>On April 9, 1994 a railway car was blown up at Khudat (Azerbaijan) station.
            </p>
            <p>On March 19, 1994 a bomb placed in one of the carriages of a train by terrorists exploded in a metro station in Baku. As a result of this act, 14 people were killed and 42 were injured.</p>
            <p>On April 13, 1994 six people were killed and three wounded at Dagestanskiye Ogni station, as a result of an explosion on a Moscow-Baku passenger train.</p>
            <p>
                On July 3, 1994 there was an explosion on a train between the «28 May» and «Genjlik» subway stations in Baku, that killed 14 people and wounded 54.
            </p>
            <p>In December 1988, a military transport aircraft on the Baku-Yerevan route with rescue-workers and humanitarian aid for victims of the Armenian earthquake on board, suffered a disaster near Yerevan in unexplained circumstances. The underlying
                motive for what may well be a «planned air disaster» is completely unprecedented. The 79 victims of this tragedy had been sent on a humanitarian mission from Azerbaijan to Armenia.
            </p>
            <p>On November 20, 1991 an Mi-8 helicopter carrying a group of peace-enforcement representatives from Russia, Kazakhstan and the senior Azerbaijani leadership were shot down near the village of Karakend in the Khojavend district of the Republic
                of Azerbaijan.The killing of 22 people, including statesmen from three countries, effectively put an end to the first attempt to settle the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict and prompted an escalation of violence in the region.
            </p>
            <p>On January 28 1992 a civilian helicopter flying on the Aghdam-Shusha route was shot down by Armenian terrorists over the Azerbaijani town of Shusha, killing 41 passengers, most of them women and children, as well as the crew.
            </p>
            <p>On January 8 1992 an explosion on the ferry «Sovetskaya Kalmykia» operating between Krasnovodsk (Turkmenistan) and Baku, claimed the lives of 25 people and injured 88. The same year an attempt to carry an explosive device on to the steamer
                «Sabit Orujev» was stopped.</p>

        <section class="7th-section" id="resolutions">
            <h1>Resolutions</h1>
            <p>Following the occupation of Azerbaijani territories in 1993, the UN Security Council adopted four resolutions: 822 (April, 30), 853 (July, 29), 874 (October, 14) and 884 (November, 11). The above-mentioned resolutions reaffirmed the sovereignty
                and territorial integrity of the Republic of Azerbaijan and of all other states in the region, the inviolability of the international borders and inadmissibility of the use of force as a means for the acquisition of territories.
            </p>
            <p>The resolutions demanded an immediate cessation of all hostile acts and an immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of occupying forces from all occupied territories of the Republic of Azerbaijan, and called for the restoration of
                the economic, transport and energy links in the region, the return of the refugees and displaced persons to the places of their permanent residence. The resolutions approved of the efforts of the OSCE Minsk Group aimed at the peaceful
                settlement of the conflict and called for the search of the ways for a settlement of the conflict in the framework of the OSCE Minsk process.
            </p>
            <p>On May 12, 1994 the cease-fire has been established. On December 5-6, 1994 at the CSCE Summit in Budapest the Heads of State and Government of the OSCE participating states took a decision in accordance to which they established the institute
                of the Co-Chairmanship of the OSCE Minsk Conference for the coordination of all mediation efforts within the CSCE framework. The Budapest Summit tasked the Chairman-in-Office to conduct negotiations aimed at the conclusion of the political
                agreement on the cessation of the armed conflict, implementation of which will eliminate the consequences of the conflict and will permit convening of the Minsk Conference. The Summit also adopted a decision on the deployment of the CSCE
                multinational peacekeeping forces after the achievement of the agreement between the Parties on the cessation of the armed conflict, and the establishment of the High Level Planning Group (HLPG) aimed at the preparation of the peacekeeping
                operation.
            </p>
            <p>The Lisbon Summit of the Heads of States and Governments of OSCE participants (since January 1, 1995 the CSCE was transformed into the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe), held on December 2-3, 1996, the Co-Chairmen of the
                OSCE Minsk Group and the OSCE Chairman-in-Office recommended the principles, which should have been the basis for the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. But Armenia did not accept them and therefore it was the only one out of
                54 OSCE participating states not to support them.
            </p>
            <p>Then the OSCE Chairman-in-Office made a statement with the inclusion of those principles. They are as follows: territorial integrity of the Republic of Armenia and the Azerbaijan Republic; legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh defined in an agreement
                based on self-determination which confers on Nagorno-Karabakh the highest degree of self-rule within Azerbaijan; guaranteed security for Nagorno-Karabakh and its whole population, including mutual obligations to ensure compliance by all
                the Parties with the provisions of the settlement. After the Lisbon Summit the institute of the triple Co-Chairmanship, including Russia, France and the USA, was established in 1997. Since April 1997 the negotiations were suspended and
                substituted by the visits of the Co-Chairmen to the region. On June 1, 1997 the Co-Chairmen presented the draft of a comprehensive agreement on the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which consisted of the Agreement on the cessation
                of the armed conflict and the Agreement on the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. Despite the readiness of Azerbaijan to start constructive consultations on the essence of the mentioned documents, the Republic of Armenia categorically rejected
                the “package” approach.
            </p>
            <p>On September 19-23, 1997, during their visit to the region, the Co-Chairmen presented new proposals based on the “stage-by-stage” approach to the settlement, according to which it was planned at the first stage to liberate 6 regions, to deploy
                the OSCE peacekeeping operation, to return the displaced persons to the liberated territories and to normalize main communications in the conflict zone. At the second stage the problems of Lachin and Shusha were to be solved and the main
                principles of the NK status were to be adopted. As a result the OSCE Minsk Conference ought to be convened. On October 10, 1997 the Presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia confirmed in their joint Statement in Strasbourg, that “the recent
                proposals of the Co-Chairmen were a hopeful basis for the resumption of negotiations within the framework of the Minsk Group”.
            </p>
            <p>But after the resignation of the President of Armenia Levon Ter-Petrossian in February of 1998 and with coming to power in March 1998 of Robert Kocharian, the next visit of the Co-Chairmen to the region took place, when Armenia officially
                withdrew the consent of the ex-president of Armenia Levon Ter-Petrossian to the proposals on the “stage-by-stage” settlement of the conflict.
            </p>
            <p>On November 9, 1998, the Co-Chairmen put forward the proposals based on the concept of a “common state”. According to this concept, Nagorno-Karabakh would have the status of a state and a territorial unit in the form of a republic, which,
                together with Azerbaijan would constitute the common state within internationally recognized borders of Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan rejected those proposals, since they violated its sovereignty and contradicted the Lisbon principles. Since
                then no new proposals were made and the Minsk process practically reached a deadlock.
            </p>
            <p>On November 18-19, 1999 the Final Document of the OSCE Istanbul Summit stressed that the Minsk Group was the most suitable framework for the settlement of the Karabakh problem, welcomed the dialogue of the two Presidents as giving an impetus
                to the Minsk process, and expressed hope for the resumption, as soon as possible, of the negotiations on the conflict settlement.
            </p>
            <p>In order to give an additional impetus to the negotiations, since April 1999 direct talks between Presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia on the achievement of conflict settlement began. However, due to Armenia’s destructive position these meetings
                have not yet led to any agreement.
            </p>
            <p>In the decisions of the OSCE Ministerial Council meetings, which were held on December 3-4, 2001 in Bucharest and on December 6-7, 2002 in Porto, the importance of continuing the peace dialogue was stated and a call to parties to continue
                the efforts on the settlement of the conflict on the basis of the norms and principles of international law was expressed.
            </p>
            <p>During their visit to the region on March 2002 Co-Chairmen proposed to conduct negotiations at the level of special representatives of the Presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia. The proposal was accepted by the Presidents of both states. On
                March 13-15 and July 29-30, 2002 the two meetings of the special representatives of the Presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan took place in Prague. The ministers of foreign affairs of two countries met in Prague on March 16, 2004.</p>
